# scRNA-seq-

RMD_01_pre-processing: Step through standard pre-processing workflow for scRNA-seq data in Seurat. Includes selection and filtration of cells based on QC metrics, data normalization and scaling, and the detection of highly variable features.
RMD_02_pre-processing:

Paper: CaSpER identifies and visualizes CNV events by integrative analysis of single-cell or bulk RNA-sequencing data

Use CaSpER algorithm applied to single-cell GBM RNA-seq dataset on GV and MII-Oocyte data. 
Goals:
1. Create Seurat object. 
2. Create CaSpER object. 
3. Identify focal and large-scale CNV events.
